- Object Oriented
- Class-based
- Platform independent (WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere)

# Features
- Simple - Java removes the ambiguity by disabling the use of pointers.
- Portable - Compiled bytecode can be run on any platform
- Object-oriented - although it uses primitive data types, but supports conversion into non-primitives by using Wrapper Classes
- Independent of the host platform - because of bytecode
- Dynamic and secure
- Robust - strong memory management, which helps to eliminate errors during compile time and run time. Automatic garbage collection to destroy unused objects.
- Supports libraries for networking
- High Performance: With the use of JIT (Just-In-Time) compilers, Java achieves high performance through the use of byte-code that can be easily translated into native machine code.
- Supports Multithreading.
- Secure - compiled bytecode is non-readable

### *Inteview Question* - 

1. Can Java bytecode be decompiled? If yes, how does it affect the security of the application?
